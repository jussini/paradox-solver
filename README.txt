===========

This is a simple app to solve the paradox clock puzzles in the video game Final Fantasy XIII-2


Paradox clock wat?
==================

Clock puzzle is one of the most annoying puzzle in any video game, ever. The player is presented
a circular plane with a varying number of slots on its edge and two clock hands. The hands will
between the slots so that the other hand goes clockwise and anothe counter clockwise. When player
selects a slot the hands will move as many steps as the number in the slot shows. Once a number has
been used it cannot be used again. Players will lose if both hands stop into slots that have been
used already and win if they can use all the slots.

It's actually very simple, but especially with larger clock faces, quite difficult and frustrating.
Poor game controller...


Ok, how does this help?
======================

This app asks you the number values of the slots, solves the puzzle for you using brute
force and displays step by step instructions on how to solve the puzzle.
